# Custom-Fields-Manager for your WordPress website
Delete custom fields in your WordPress database

This plugin adds a new "Custom Fields" menu item in the WordPress admin menu. When the user clicks on it, the plugin displays a list of all custom fields in the database, excluding some internal fields like _edit_last and _edit_lock.

For each custom field, the plugin provides a "Delete" button that allows you to remove the custom field from the database.

To use this plugin, simply install and activate it in your WordPress site. Then, go to the "Custom Fields" menu item in the admin menu to manage your custom fields.
